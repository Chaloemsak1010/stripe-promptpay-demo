🧍‍♂️ User Actions

User clicks “Buy” / “Pay” on your site.

Your frontend calls a backend route → /api/checkout.

Backend creates a Stripe Checkout Session via the Stripe API.

Stripe returns a Checkout URL.

The frontend redirects user to that Checkout page.

User completes payment on Stripe’s hosted page (PromptPay, card, etc.).

Stripe redirects back to your site → /success?session_id=....

Your frontend calls /api/session to verify payment status and display result.

(Optional) Stripe also sends webhook events to your server for final confirmation and database updates.
